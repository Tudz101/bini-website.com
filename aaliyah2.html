            <h3>Da Coconut Nut</h3>
            <p>BINI’s pre-debut single “Da Coconut Nut” pays homage to Filipino singer-composer and National Artist, Maestro Ryan Cayabyab.

                BINI’s version of this uniquely Filipino tune was given a new flavor, fun and light, just like the BINI members' colorful personalities!</p>

        <div class="products-col">
            <h3>8</h3>
            <p>Unlike the other songs on the album, 8 is a bit slower and a laid-back jam.

                On the surface, the song is about friendship, but it wouldn’t be hard to imagine that it is also about BINI themselves. After all, the song’s title is 8 and there are eight members in BINI. 
                The phrase, walo hanggang dulo, is also repeated a few times in the track.
                
                The song could serve as a reflection of BINI’s journey, how after all the training and hardships they’ve been through, they finally reached or are aiming to reach their goal as a team.</p>

            <h3>strings</h3>
            <p>BINI, the P-pop act dubbed the “nation’s girl group,” ushered in its new music era Thursday with the release of its comeback single “Strings,” notably featuring a fiercer image for the girls known for their bubblegum pop hits.

                Depicting the lyrics about overcoming challenges, Aiah, Stacey, Maloi, Jhoanna, Gwen, Colet, Sheena, and Mikha are seen falling from the symbolic strings, before transforming to reflect their grit and determination.
                
                “Strings” was composed by Robert Perena, the members of BINI, and Jonathan Manalo, with music arrangement by Theo Martel and Manalo and vocal arrangement by Anna Graham.
                
                The premiere of “Strings” coincided with the release of BINI’s sophomore album “Feel Good,” which contains seven tracks including the pre-album single “I Feel Good.”</p>

                    <h3>Golden Arrow</h3>
                    <p>“Golden Arrow” sonically features a nice disco-funk sound, which is something that is also present in other songs on the album. 
                        The track continues the empowerment vibe in Born To Win as the girls sing about feeling confident and being reassured of themselves.
                         While you get down on the dance floor, it wants you to feel like you got this.</p>

                    <h3>I Feel Good</h3>
                    <p>Rainbows, unicorns, and everything pretty in between – that’s what you’ll feel when you jam to BINI’s newest bubblegum bop, “I Feel Good.”

                        It’s a popular opinion that the one and only nation’s girl group owns this concept, and they’re doing this effortlessly as if they are born to make our hearts pop every comeback!
                        
                        A bright, refreshing era has dawned for the eight girls of BINI with the release of “I Feel Good” after the success of perky “Na Na Na” and peppy “Lagi.” Continuing BINI’s first love story, IFG is a colorful track that describes the blissful feeling of being with someone we love or even just with the one we have a happy crush on.
                        
                        All hail BINI for reintroducing the bubblegum pop back in the P-pop queendom, and they’re slaying this like no other.</p>

                    <h3>Born to win</h3>
                    <p>“Born To Win” is the debut single of BINI. It is a song about overcoming one’s struggles and challenges they are facing in climbing up the ladder.</p>

                    <p>Midway through the album, BINI takes a bit of a detour as the next couple of songs revolve around romantic love. 
                        At first, “Na Na Na” sounds like a typical romantic song about falling in love. But as you go through the song, 
                        it turns into a track about how you keep falling into the same mistakes and ignore the red flags, something a lot of people can relate to.</p>

                         a perky love song that charted atop the iTunes Philippines chart and landed on various Spotify editorial playlists upon its release.

                        “Lagi” is a colorful pop song that highlights all the magical and exciting feelings that the presence of a new lover brings to one’s life.
                         A track with an addictive chorus and hook, “Lagi” was written and composed by Louie Canaria and arranged by Ramiru Mataro, with vocal production by ABS-CBN Music creative director Jonathan Manalo.
                        
                        Aside from topping the local iTunes chart after it dropped, 
                        “Lagi” was also included in Spotify’s New Music Friday Philippines playlist and placed first in other editorial playlists like P-Pop on the Rise and RADAR Philippines.
